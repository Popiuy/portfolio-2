## Description 
This project was made with no source code. I used old assignments to frame the webpage and then styled it independently. I used correct html semantics to order the page. I coded the webpage to be able to show my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. The UI scrolls to each section when clicked in the nav. The first application is the biggest and has working links to the deployed webpage aswell as the code.
